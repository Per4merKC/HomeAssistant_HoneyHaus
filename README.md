# HoneyHaus

This is my configuration... I'm new to Home-Assistant, but have roots back 
in the [Mister House](http://misterhouse.net) days. :-)

I plan on trying to recreate some of the awesome scripts from those days and 
integrating them with modern technology and convienence.

* Raspberry Pi 3 running Hass.io
* Vera Controller
  * X10 CM11a Interface
  
    * Dining Room Chandelier
    * Kitchen Lights
    * Guest Bedroom Light
    * Toaster *(wall plug is not utilized in any automations)
    
  * Z-Wave
  
    * Fibaro Eye
    * 3 Leviton Plug-In Dimmer Modules
    * 2 Aeotec Recessed Door Sensors
    * 2 BeSense Ceiling PIR Motion Detectors
    * GE Outdoor Module
    
* IKEA Tr√•dfri
  * Bathroom Sink Light
